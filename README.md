From the Notebook:
* You will build a Neural Machine Translation (NMT) model to translate human-readable dates ("25th of June, 2009") into machine-readable dates ("2009-06-25"). 
* You will do this using an attention model, one of the most sophisticated sequence-to-sequence models. 

This notebook was produced together with NVIDIA's Deep Learning Institute.
